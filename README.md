# Optical-recognition-of-handwritten-digits-dataset-DNN
Use CNN and NN to train the Optical-recognition-of-handwritten-digits-dataset

## Implementation of the following functionalities:

### f1:
design and build two different deep neural networks, one with convolutional layer and the other without convolutional layer;

### f2: 
apply model evaluation on the learned models. For the materials on model evaluation, you may take a look at the metrics explained in the lecture “model evaluation”. You are required to implement by yourself (i.e., do not call built-in libraries)

(a) the cross-validation of 5 subsamples,

(b) the confusion matrix, and

(c) the ROC curve for one class vs. all other classes for

(a) the two neural networks you trained in f1, and

(b) the two traditional machine learning algorithms in the first assignment.
